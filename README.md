# Situationship-Analytics
## Project Overview
**Situationship Analytics** is a data-driven exploration of how my Instagram activity correlates with failed situationships. This project investigates whether my Instagram usage during these periods follows a hypothesized behavioral pattern. Specifically, I suspect that my activity shows an initial increase in posts, stories, and screen time as a way to enhance engagement with the other person. This is followed by a slight decrease during active communication and a significant drop when the situationship deteriorates and ultimately ends. The goal of this project is to determine whether this pattern is consistently observable or if the perceived correlation is unfounded.

## Data Source
To explore this hypothesis, I will use Instagram's Data Download Tool to retrieve personal activity data. This includes posts, stories, and screen time records for three distinct periods of failed situationships: October 2023 to January 2024 (x1), August 2024 (x2), and October 2024 to November 2024 (x3). While these analyses focus solely on my actions, I will ensure the privacy of all individuals involved by excluding any personally identifiable information about them. The analysis will be limited to my own data, providing an introspective lens on how I engage with Instagram during these emotionally charged periods.

## Methodology
The project will involve parsing and analyzing the retrieved data using Python. A custom script will be developed to process and clean the data, focusing on metrics such as the frequency of posts, the number of stories, and screen time duration. Using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn, I will create visualizations to illustrate activity trends over the specified periods. These visual representations will help in validating or debunking the hypothesized Instagram activity pattern during situationships.

## Project Outputs
The final outputs of this project will include a Python script containing the methods used for data parsing and visualization. Additionally, I will produce detailed visual representations that highlight Instagram activity trends across the three analyzed periods. These deliverables will help draw conclusions about whether my Instagram usage aligns with the proposed behavioral pattern or if there is no significant correlation.

## Next Steps / Plans for Improvement
After completing the initial analysis, there are several directions I plan to take the project to refine and deepen the insights:

- **WhatsApp Data Integration:** I may add data from WhatsApp to analyze messaging patterns and compare it with Instagram usage. This could provide a more comprehensive view of how my communication style across different platforms correlates with my behavior during situationships.

- **Spotify Data Analysis:** I also plan to integrate Spotify data to explore the genres of music I listen to during these periods. By analyzing the trends in my music preferences, I can gain additional insight into my emotional state. Furthermore, I could calculate sentiment values based on the music I listen to and link these with the Instagram and WhatsApp usage data, potentially revealing a more nuanced picture of my mood throughout the various stages of each situationship.

These enhancements will allow for a more thorough understanding of the patterns that emerge during failed situationships, offering a deeper emotional and behavioral analysis across multiple platforms.
