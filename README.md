# Situationship-Analytics

## Project Overview

Situationship Analytics is a data-driven exploration that begins with an analysis of my own Instagram activity and then investigates how this activity correlates with failed situationships. The project is structured in two parts:

1. **Instagram Activity Analysis**: The first phase involves examining my personal Instagram activity, focusing on the topics that interest me, the number of posts, stories, and posts that I liked. This analysis aims to understand how my Instagram behavior evolves over time, particularly during emotionally charged periods like situationships.

2. **Situationship Analysis**: The second phase explores how my Instagram usage aligns with the time intervals of three distinct failed situationships. Specifically, I investigate whether there is any correlation between my Instagram activity (such as posts, stories, and screen time) and the progression of these failed situationships. My hypothesis is that my activity shows an increase in engagement (posts, stories, etc.) initially, followed by a decrease during active communication and a significant drop when the situationship deteriorates and ends.

Since there are only three situationships being analyzed, the number of data points is limited, which makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, I will focus on these three situationships to explore any patterns that might emerge.

The ultimate goal of this project is to determine whether this hypothesized pattern is observable across the periods of failed situationships or if the perceived correlation is unfounded.

## Data Source

To explore this hypothesis, I will use Instagram's Data Download Tool to retrieve personal activity data. This includes posts, stories, screen time records, and liked posts, with a focus on the following:

- **Topics of Interest**: The topics I engage with most frequently on Instagram.
- **Post and Story Counts**: The number of posts and stories shared during these periods.
- **Liked Posts**: The number of posts that I liked.

The analysis will focus entirely on my own data, and the privacy of all individuals involved will be maintained by excluding any personally identifiable information. The analysis is introspective, providing insights into my Instagram usage during three specific failed situationships, with the following time intervals:
- October 2023 to January 2024 (x1)
- August 2024 (x2)
- October 2024 to November 2024 (x3)

## Methodology

The project will involve parsing and analyzing the retrieved Instagram data using Python. A custom script will be developed to process and clean the data, focusing on metrics such as:
- Frequency of posts and stories
- Number of likes on posts
- Topics of interest
- Screen time records

Using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn, I will create visualizations to illustrate trends in my Instagram activity over time, both before and during the failed situationships. These visualizations will serve to validate or challenge the hypothesized Instagram activity pattern.

## Project Outputs

The final outputs of this project will include:
1. Two Python scripts that parse and visualize the Instagram data.
2. Visual representations of my Instagram activity trends across the three specified periods.
3. Insights into how my activity changes during the failed situationships and whether it aligns with the hypothesized behavioral pattern.

## Next Steps / Plans for Improvement

After completing the initial analysis, there are several avenues for expanding the project:

- **WhatsApp Data Integration**: Adding WhatsApp data to analyze messaging patterns in parallel with Instagram usage, potentially offering more comprehensive insights into my behavior during situationships.

- **Spotify Data Analysis**: Integrating Spotify data to analyze music genres and sentiment values during these periods. This could provide an additional layer of emotional context and help refine the overall analysis of my mood and behavior.

By integrating additional data sources, I will be able to deepen the emotional and behavioral analysis across multiple platforms, enhancing the understanding of patterns during failed situationships.
